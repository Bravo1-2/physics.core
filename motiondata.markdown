# [Chapter] Motion

## [Topic] Introduction
- [Definition] If the position of an object changes with respect to time, then it is in *motion*.
- [Definition] If the position of an object does not changes with respect to time, then the object is said to be at *Rest or Stationary*
- [Concept] *Motion is relative*:- The state of motion of an object depends on the point from where it is observed, i.e. the *reference frame or the Origin.*

    - [Formula] It is denoted by $\Delta X$
    - [Formula] $\Delta X = X_f - X_i$; where $X_f$ is the final position and $X_i$ is the initial position
    - [Property] It can be positive, zero as well as negative

## [Topic] Uniform Motion
- [Definition] If a body, covers equal distance in equal intervals of time, then the motion is said to be uniform motion

## [Topic] Non-uniform Motion
- [Definition] If a body doesn't, cover equal distance in equal intervals of time, the the motion is said to be *non-uniform motion*.

## [Topic] Speed
- [Property] Generally, the rate of change in motion is not uniform.
- [Definition] Speed is a physical quantity, that decides how fast/slow an object moves.
- [Definition] Speed is defined as the distance travelled by an body in unit time.
- [Formula] Mathematically,  $Speed = \frac{Distance travelled}{Time taken}$
- [Property] Its SI Unit is m/s or $ms^-1$
- [Property] It can also be denoted in Km/hr

## [Topic] Uniform Speed
- [Definition] If an object travels equal distance in equal time intervals then the object is said to move with uniform speed

## [Topic] Average Speed
- [Definition] The average speed of a body is defined as the total distance travelled by the total time taken.
- [Formula] Mathematically, $Average Speed = \frac{Total Distance}{Total Time}$

## [Topic] Velocity
- [Property] Speed tells us how fast the object moved only; it gives no information of the direction in which th eobject moved
- [Definition] Speed along with direction is known as velocity
- [Definition] Velocity can also be defined as the rate of change of displacement.
- [Formula] $Velocity = \frac{Displacement}{Time Interval}$
- [Property] It is a vector quantity. Therefore, direction of movement is important
- [Property] Its SI Unit is also m/s or $ms^-1$

## [Topic] Uniform Velocity
- [Definition] If the velocity of an object does not change with time then the object is said to move with uniform velocity

## [Topic] Average Velocity
- [Fact/Observation] The velocity of an object generally changes many times during a motion
- [Reason] Thus Average Velocity is required
- [Formula] $Average Velocity = \frac{Total Displacement}{Total Time taken}$
- [Formula] $Average Velocity = \frac{Initial Velocity + Final Velocity}{2}$ $(\bar{v} = \frac{u + v}{2})$

## [Topic] Acceleration
- [Fact/Observation] During a non-unifrom velocity motion, velocity of an object changes.
- [Definition] Change in velocity with respect to time is known as acceleration
- [Definition] It is also defined as the rate of change is velocity of an object
- [Formula] $Acceleration = \frac{Final Velocity - Initial Velocity}{Time taken}$ $(a = \frac{v - u}{t})$
- [Property] It is a vector quantity
- [Property] Its SI Unit is $m/s^2$ or $ms^-2$
- [Concept] If the velocity of an object increases in the direction of motion itself, then the acceleration is said to be positive
- [Concept] If the velocity of an object increases in the direction opposite to that of motion, then the acceleration is said to be negative
- [Definition] Negative acceleration is also known as retardation or deaccleration
 
## [Topic] Uniform Acceleration
- [Definition] If the rate of change in velocity does not change with time, then the object is said to have uniform acceleration
- [Fact] An object is said to have a uniform acceleration if
    - [Observation] It travels in a specific direction
    - [Obsevation] Its velocity changes (increases or decreases) by equal amounts in equal time intervals
- [Examples] Motion of any free falling object; Motion of any object rolling down a slope

## [Topic] Graphical Representation
### [Subtopic] Distance - Time Graph
- [Fact] Using it, we can
    - [Observation] Know the type of motion
    - [Observation] Calculate speed of the object
    - [Observation] Compare speed
### [Subtopic] Calculating Speed using Distance-Time Graph
- [Formula] $Speed = \frac{Distance Travelled}{Time Taken}$
- [Example] $Speed = \frac{20 m}{5 sec} = 4 m/s$
### [Subtopic] Velocity - Time Graph
- [Fact] Using it, we can
    - [Observation] Identify the type of motion
    - [Observation] Calculate acceleration
    - [Observation] Calculate distance travelelled by an object

## [Topic] Mathematical Derivation (1st Equation of Motion)
[Derivation] For uniformly acceleration motion,
Acceleration,  $a = \frac{v - u}{t}$\
$= \quad at = v - u$\
$= \quad u + at = v$\
$\therefore \quad v = u + at$

## [Topic] Mathematical Derivation (2nd Equation of Motion)
[Derivation] For uniformly accelerated motion,\
Average Velocity, $V_av = \frac{v + u}{2}$\
Also Average Velocity, $V_av = \frac{Total Displacement}{Total Time} = \frac{s}{t}$\
$\therefore \quad \frac{v + u}{2} = \frac{s}{t}$\
$= \quad s = t(\frac{v + u}{2})$\
Substituing $v = u + at$ in it, we get $s = t(\frac{u + at + u}{t}) = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$

## [Topic] Mathematical Derivation (3rd Equation of Motion)
[Derivation] From 1st equation of motion, $t = \frac{v - u}{a}$\
Also from $\frac{t(v + u)}{2} = (\frac{v - u}{a})(\frac{v + u}{2}) = \frac{v^2 - u^2}{2a}$\
$\therefore \quad 2as = v^2 - u^2$

## [Topic] Circular Motion
- [Definition] A body is said to be in circular motion when it rotates about a fix point
- [Definition] A body moving in a circular path at a constant speed is said to be in uniform circular motion
- [Fact/Observation] In circular motion, the velocity is never constant as the speed of the moving body can be constant but the direction keeps on changing.
- [Example] It is also an example of uniform acceleration motion
- [Formula] Speed of the object = $\frac{Total distance}{Total time taken} = \frac{2Ï€r}{t}$
